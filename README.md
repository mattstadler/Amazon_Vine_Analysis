# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
- The purpose of this project was to analyze Amazon reviews, and ultimately determine whether 5 star reviews were correlated with paid vs. unpaid accounts.

## Results
- Vine reviews: 312
- non-Vine reviews: 57,608
- Vine 5-star reviews: 129
- non-Vine 5-star reviews: 30,643
- % 5 star Vine reviews: 41.3%
- % 5 star non-Vine reviews: 53.2%

## Summary
- It appears that the unpaid accounts tend to have higher frequency of 5 star reviews vs. the unpaid accounts (53.2% vs. 41.3%). An additional analysis could be to look at reviews of these users on other products -- perhaps there is a selection bias among unpaid account users, which may be acting as a confounding variable.
